    $myname = "victor c nwafor";
    $myNameArray = ["Victor","Chigozie","Nwafor"];
    echo count($myNameArray); // this function will count the items in the array

    $resplace_some_string_in_my_name = str_replace("c","k",$myname); // search for every occurence of "c" in $myname and replace with "k"


    // you can play around with more functions here to know how they work.
